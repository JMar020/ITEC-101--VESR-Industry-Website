    <p>
      My top four personal values are compassion, accountability, respect, and integrity.
      These values guide how I treat people and how I handle responsibilities in both school and work.
      They matter most when situations are stressful and it would be easy to react poorly or take shortcuts.
    </p>

    <h2>Compassion</h2>
    <p>
      Compassion means recognizing when someone is struggling and responding with patience instead of judgment.
      It is about understanding others and not making situations harder than they already are.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value comes from my family and from experiences in school and work, where I learned that everyone is dealing with something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compassion is important because it helps people feel respected and comfortable communicating openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do not practice compassion, I can come across as impatient or uncaring, which can damage relationships and trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      Accountability means taking responsibility for my actions and following through on commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value comes from being raised with expectations and learning that excuses do not fix outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accountability is important because it builds reliability and shows others that I take my responsibilities seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I avoid accountability, I can lose credibility and make things harder for the people who depend on me.
    </p>

    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <p>
      Respect means treating people with dignity, listening, and keeping communication calm and professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value comes from my upbringing and from working with different people in team settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respect is important because it reduces conflict and makes collaboration easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do not show respect, it can quickly create tension and harm how others see me.
    </p>

    <h2>Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      Integrity is being honest and doing the right thing even when it is inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value comes from how I was raised and from seeing how quickly trust disappears when people are dishonest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrity is important because it protects my reputation and keeps relationships genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do not act with integrity, I risk losing trust, opportunities, and respect from others.
