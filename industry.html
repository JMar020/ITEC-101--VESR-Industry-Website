    <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I chose the healthcare industry because it deals with sensitive information and also depends on systems being available at all times.
      Healthcare organizations store patient records, insurance information, and scheduling systems, and if those systems get compromised it can affect privacy and patient safety.
    </p>

    <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
    <p>
      A career that interests me in healthcare is becoming a registered nurse, especially in a fast paced setting like an emergency department.
      In this role, I would be communicating with patients and staff, documenting care, and using electronic systems throughout the shift.
      Since nurses rely heavily on technology during patient care, understanding cybersecurity is important for both efficiency and safety.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethical Issue in Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
      One ethical issue that could come up in healthcare is patient privacy.
      For example, a staff member might look up a patient’s record out of curiosity, share information in a public area, or access information that they do not need for their job.
      Even if it is not done with bad intentions, it still violates trust and can harm the patient.
    </p>

    <h2>How My Personal Values Shape My Response</h2>
    <p>
      My personal values are compassion, accountability, respect, and integrity, and those would guide how I handle privacy situations.
      Compassion matters because patients deserve to feel safe and not judged, especially when they are already stressed.
      Accountability matters because if I make a mistake, I should report it and fix it instead of hiding it.
      Respect matters because patient information is personal and it should be treated seriously.
      Integrity matters because I should do the right thing even when no one is watching, including following policies and only accessing what I need.
    </p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Issues That Could Arise</h2>
    <p>
      Healthcare faces cybersecurity issues like ransomware, phishing emails, stolen login credentials, and unauthorized access to patient records.
      A major target is the electronic health record system, also known as the EHR, because it stores large amounts of sensitive data in one place.
      If a staff member clicks a malicious link, reuses passwords, or leaves a computer unlocked, it can lead to a breach.
      Busy emergency department environments and shared workstations can make it easier for unauthorized access to occur if proper precautions are not followed.
    </p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices in Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
      Strong access control limits what employees can see and reduces damage if an account is compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection to prevent unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular software updates help fix security vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure backups protect systems from ransomware and data loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee training helps reduce phishing attacks and unsafe behavior, which is especially important in fast paced emergency department workflows where staff are multitasking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incident response plans help organizations react quickly and reduce damage during security incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Why These Practices Matter</h2>
    <p>
      In healthcare, cybersecurity protects patient information and helps keep systems available so patients can still receive care.
      It supports privacy, safety, and trust.
